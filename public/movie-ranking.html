<h1>The Best Movies According to Fernando</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-times</h2> 
<hr>

<h3>Long Live Love</h3>
<p>It's a Thailand movie, I love it because show how divorce can affect teens and how sometimes we would like to change our past so we can be better in the future</p>
<h3>Encanto</h3>
<p>A nice Disney Movie it suppose to be for kids but if you are an adult watching this movie you can identify yourself with Maribel</p>
<h3>Turning Red</h3>
<p>Similar to Encanto but differents perspectives and hey! don't forget your inner child</p>
